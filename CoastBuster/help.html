        <h1>Take a Photo</h1>
        <hr/>
        <p>To begin:
        <ol>
            <li>Tap the "Take a debris photo" button and take a photo of debris that you find.</li>
            <li>Once you get a good shot in the Preview pane, click "Use" accept it.</li>
            <li>Select a composition and category that best match it.</li>
            <li>Try to fill in additional optional information that may help the scientists using the data.</li>
            <li>Tap "Save" to save it.</li>
        </ol>
        <strong>Note:</strong>  Location Services will have to be turned on for Coastbuster in your Settings before you will be able to take a photo.  The GPS position is required so that all photos have a geolocation attached to them.

        <h1>View and upload images</h1>
        <hr/>
        <p>When you have saved at least one image, tap the "View and upload images" button to access the photos you have taken.  </p>
        <p>From "View and upload images" you can
        <ul>
            <li>Tap a photo to view it in full screen</li>
            <li>Tap the blue arrow icon to view or edit photo information you have entered</li>
            <li>Tap the "Edit / Upload" button to delete or upload one or more photos, or rearrange photos in the list by dragging them.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><Strong>Uploading:</strong>  When you tap the Upload button, you can choose to keep the selected photos or delete them from your device once the upload is has successfully completed.  If you choose to keep them and then re-upload them at a later time, the newly uploaded data will overwrite the previously-uploaded data.</p>
        
        <p>You are given a unique "Coastbuster ID" when you upload data for the first time.  Your Coastbuster ID is displayed on the home page.</p>
        
        <p>You can view pictures on the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/coastbuster">Coastbuster Flickr page</a> (http://www.flickr.com/photos/coastbuster).  There you can filter the images using your Coastbuster ID to display only the photos that you have taken, along with the related information you provided.</p>

        <h1>About</h1>
        <hr/>
        <p><strong>Beach keepers and coastal safety officers need your help!</strong>  They need to know about large, unusual, and potentially hazardous marine debris -- especially items that may have been swept into the sea by Japan's devastating March 2011 tsunami.  You can help keep our coast clean and safe by reporting debris via the Coastbuster app.  Simply take pictures of the debris you find, enter some descriptions, and upload to Ocean Networks Canada.  We will forward your reports to authorities.  We'll also upload your photos to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/coastbuster">Flickr</a>, where you can browse, share and comment on the full collection of marine debris snapshots.</p>
        
        <p>The information and photos you share can also help scientists to better understand how winds and currents carry marine debris in the oceans.</p>
        
        <p>The uploaded data contains no personal information from your device.  All data that we store is completely anonymous.  The data uploaded contains the image, the UTC time the photo was taken, the geolocation at that time, the category and composition you selected, as well as any comment you may have added.  When you upload data for the first time, you are given a unique "Coastbuster ID".  This ID is associated with all photos that you take with the app, and you can use it on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/coastbuster">Flickr (http://www.flickr.com/photos/coastbuster)</a> to filter and view photos you have taken.  On the website, you can also view all photos taken and filter based on location, or fields such as category and composition.  You must agree to <i><a href="http://www.oceannetworkscanada.ca/coastbuster#termsofuse">Terms of Use</a></i> before using the Coastbuster Application.</p>
        
        <h4>We appreciate your support and participation in the inventory of landed debris!</h4>
